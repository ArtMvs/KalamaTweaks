- improvement of all aspects of our device)

After the first installation (and update if I specify):

- reboot a couple of times (at intervals of ~10 minutes so that all inits pass)
- clear cache/garbage in the phone manager, also delete data and camera cache.
- put the phone on charge for the night (so that dex recompilation is performed and this eliminates heating of the device and CPU occupancy due to changes in dalvik, the same thing happens to you after each ota update when they write that the device should be used for a couple of days and charged with the screen off)

How to update the module:

- Delete the old version and reboot before installing the new one, you cannot update over. When installing, the module is assembled with your current files. After installing the ota system update, you must also reinstall the module (so that the module is assembled with your new files)

  Warnings and notes:

- The module is made for the latest builds of rui 6.0 android 15. (And is immediately sawed under the new build, but you can also use the updated module on the old firmware)

- the 120hz version gives stock 120Hz in the launcher, the version without this postscript gives 144Hz in the launcher.

- do not install magisk kitsune/kitsune mask, this is very bad, only official magisk canary is supported, ksu should be supported.

- do not do in luckytool what the module gives you.

- do not install modules that are similar in action (extremegt and others, but you can delete the files inside the archive that are also in my module and install)

- do not use the dynamic island module, there will be a conflict, it is in cos 15 in the form of live notifications.

- after the first installation, the selective hertz for some applications will be disabled once

  KalamaExtraPack. Undervolt config for only for GT5.
