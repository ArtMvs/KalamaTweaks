- improvement of all aspects of our device)
- the rest is in the changelogs

After the first installation (and update if I specify):

- reboot a couple of times (at intervals of ~10 minutes so that all inits pass)
- clear cache/garbage in the phone manager, also delete data and camera cache

How to update the module:

- Delete the old version and reboot before installing the new one, when trying to update over the top, the module will be automatically deleted and rebooted. When installing, the module is assembled with your current files. After installing the ota system update, you must also reinstall the module (so that the module is assembled with your new files)

Warnings and notes:

- The module is made for the latest builds of rui 6.0 android 15. (And is immediately sawed under the new build, but you can also use the updated module on the old firmware)

- choosing 144Hz/vol+ gives 144Hz in the launcher, vol- leaves the stock state. As I said earlier, at 144Hz there will be a torn animation of unlocking, provided that you unlock from the lock screen, from a black screen with a fingerprint, the animation is processed normally. This behavior at 144Hz is due to the fact that in coloros on the lock screen the frequency of 120Hz is constantly hammered in (the overlay is always highlighted), it is, to put it mildly, forced, because of this, the animation is torn, and on the butt version this prolag is imperceptible.

- do not install magisk kitsune/kitsune mask, it is very bad, only official magisk canary and KSU are supported.

- do not do in luckytool what the module gives you.

- do not install modules that are similar in action (extremegt and others, but you can delete the files inside the archive that are also in my module and install)

- after the first installation, the selective hz for some applications will reset once
